    <h1>Privacy Policy for Background Remover Pro</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: November 12, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Background Remover Pro ("we," "our," or "the App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how our app handles your data.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Background Remover Pro is designed with privacy in mind. We want to be transparent about what data we do and do not collect:</p>
    
    <h3>2.1 Data We DO NOT Collect</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not collect any personal information (name, email, phone number, etc.)</li>
        <li>We do not track your location</li>
        <li>We do not collect your device identifiers</li>
        <li>We do not upload your photos or images to any server</li>
        <li>We do not share your data with third parties</li>
        <li>We do not use analytics or tracking services</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Local Data Processing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>All image processing is performed locally on your device</li>
        <li>Images are processed using on-device AI technology</li>
        <li>Your photos remain on your device at all times</li>
        <li>Processed images are saved only to your device's gallery (with your permission)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Permissions We Request</h2>
    <p>Our app requests the following permissions to function properly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera Access:</strong> To take photos directly within the app for background removal</li>
        <li><strong>Photo Gallery Access:</strong> To select existing photos from your device for processing</li>
        <li><strong>Storage Access:</strong> To save processed images back to your device</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These permissions are used solely for the app's core functionality and are never used to collect or transmit your data.</p>

    <h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect any personal information, there is no data usage beyond the local processing of images on your device. All image processing happens offline, and no data leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to share processed images using your device's sharing capabilities.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Storage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Original and processed images are stored only on your device</li>
        <li>You have complete control over your images and can delete them at any time</li>
        <li>We do not maintain any cloud storage or backup of your images</li>
        <li>Temporary processing files are automatically deleted after use</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Background Remover Pro does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. The app functions completely independently without external connections.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. Since no data is collected, our app is safe for users of all ages.</p>

    <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
    <p>While we do not collect data, we implement security best practices in our app:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All processing happens locally on your device</li>
        <li>No network communication for image processing</li>
        <li>Images are protected by your device's security measures</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>You have complete control over your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can revoke app permissions at any time through your device settings</li>
        <li>You can delete the app and all associated data by uninstalling it</li>
        <li>You can delete processed images from your gallery at any time</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>

    <h2>11. International Users</h2>
    <p>Since all data processing occurs locally on your device and we do not collect any personal information, our app complies with international privacy regulations including GDPR (EU), CCPA (California), and similar privacy laws worldwide.</p>
